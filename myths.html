            <h2>Ten Blood Donation Myths and the Real Truth</h2>
            <p>Disclaimer: These myths have been answered by various blood banks in Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. While different blood bank systems have slightly different rules, for example, <em></em>The Blood Center</em> in Louisiana and Mississippi will take donors as young as 16, while in Arizona the minimum age is 17, these are answers which are specific to their area, and correct in a general way. Your local blood bank will be able to give you answers specific to the regulations in your area.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Myth: Giving blood is inconvenient.</strong><br>
                Truth: From the time you sign in, the whole donation process takes under an hour. Your actual donation time will be less than ten minutes. With donor centers located throughout the Southern Louisiana and Mississippi Gulf Coast area, and blood drives held nearly every day of the year, our highly-trained staff works hard to make the process as convenient as possible for you.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Myth: I might get a disease from donating blood.</strong><br>
                Truth: All of our equipment is brand new, state-of-the-art, disposable and used only one time. The only thing you can get from donating blood is the good feeling knowing you've helped others.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Myth: They don't really need my type.</strong><br>
                Truth: Every type is the right type. All types, including common ones like O-positive and A-positive, are needed by patients all the time. The only wrong type is the type we do not have.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Myth: I'm too young or too old.</strong><br>
                Truth: You can donate blood as long as you are at least 16 years old. And you are never too old as long as you are healthy. There is absolutely no upper age limit on donating blood.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Myth: Other people must be giving enough blood.</strong><br>
                Truth: Actually, less than 5% of the eligible population actually donates blood. Yet the demand for blood and blood components is constant. The needs of patients can only be met by people like you.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Myth: Vegetarians cannot donate blood.</strong><br>
                Truth: It is true that vegetarians take longer to recover the iron lost from blood donations. That is because iron found in vegetables is not absorbed as well by the body as iron from animal protein. However, vegetarians who want to donate regularly can take iron supplements.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Myth: There’s a substitute for human blood</strong><br>
                Truth: Although scientists are testing hemoglobin-based substitutes for blood and a product called SANGUINATE™, nothing is currently available to replace human blood. And every two seconds, someone in the United States is in need of blood.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Myth: If I’ve traveled outside the U.S. I’m not eligible to donate blood.</strong><br>
                Truth: Travel to certain countries at certain times can lead to deferral, but not all travel excludes you from giving blood. If you are a frequent traveler and you have any questions about travel and blood donation eligibility, please contact your nearest Carter BloodCare donor center location.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Myth: A person is allowed to donate only once each year.</strong><br>
                Truth: The human body replaces the amount of donated blood every 56 days. There is no need to wait longer than eight weeks as long as you are healthy.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Myth: I heard that I can’t donate blood because.../strong><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>I have diabetes.</strong><br>
                        Truth: As long as your diabetes is under control and stable, you can donate!
                
                        <li><strong>I just got my ears pierced.</strong><br>
                         Truth: If your ears were pierced with a sterile, single-use kit, there is no wait!</li>
                
                        <li><strong>I have a heart condition.</strong><br>
                        Truth: As long as you are not on any heart medication (other than aspirin) and there is no underlying damage, you can donate!</li>
                
                        <li><strong>I am taking medications for mitral valve prolapse.</strong><br>
                        Truth: You may donate, as long as your doctor has not put any restrictions on your activity.</li>
                
                        <li><strong>I had a stroke.</strong><br>
                        Truth: As long as it has been a year since your stroke, are not on any medications for it and you have no activity restrictions, you can donate!</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>I just got a tattoo.</strong><br>
                        Truth: As long as your tattoo was done at a licensed shop in Louisiana, Texas, Alabama or Mississippi, you only have to wait one month!</li>
