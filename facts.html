                <p>Whole blood donations are sometimes broken up into component parts: platelets, plasma, and red blood cells. In this way, a single donation can be used to help three different people with different needs. </p>
                <p>Someone who has trouble clotting needs platelets, someone with anemia may need red cells, while someone who’s been in a traffic accident may need plasma to get their volume back up to safe levels.</p>
                <p>According to the Red Cross Blood Facts page<sup>1</sup>, approximately 36,000 units of red blood cells nearly 7,000 units of platelets and 10,000 units of plasma are needed daily, and nearly 21 million blood components are transfused each year in the U.S.</p>

                <p>If a person gets the wrong blood type, their body’s antibodies will attack and destroy the new blood. They may become very ill, and even die in the midst of this blood war happening in their veins. This chart<sup>2</sup> shows which blood types are compatible, so that safe donation can be made.</p>

                <img class="left" src="images/broken-pie.png" alt="chart showing percentage of people who know their blood type and who donate">
                <p>An informal poll on Facebook<sup>3</sup> revealed that 21.4% of the respondants didn’t know their blood type...and that of the 78.6% who did know their blood type, only 37.5% were blood donors. This means that around 40% of people who know what it is they have to give, either cannot donate, or choose not to give what they have. </p>

                <p>Further, the same poll<sup>3</sup> revealed that even those who donate, do not donate as often as they can. The majority of them don’t even donate once a year. </p>

                <br>
                <p>This chart shows the general distribution of blood types throughout various races<sup>4</sup>. The most common types overall are O+ and A+, while AB- is the most rare. </p>
                <p>O-, the "Universal donor" type is very rare. In case you were wondering, blood type is the only determining factor in who can receive blood - race has nothing to do with it.</p>
