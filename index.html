            <h1>Give and Take: One Woman's Story</h1>
            <p>November 2013. I’d long been a blood donor, and was one donation short of six gallons. In August my menstrual cycle had gone crazy, and I’d been flowing heavily more often than not. I got an appointment with my doctor to find out what was happening. For about the last week before my appointment, I’d been using a cane to walk, because I was very weak and dizzy, and I didn’t want to fall. I walked into the office, and they did all the usual things, weight, temperature, blood pressure, and I waited for my doctor. to come in. She came in, took one look at my face, asked if someone had driven me to the appointment - because if I had someone to drive, they could drive me across and just down the street to the hospital, but if I’d driven myself, she was calling an ambulance for me.</p>
            <p>I had a driver, so we went off to the hospital. My doctor said she’d call and let them know we were on our way. When we got to the hospital, they weren’t expecting us. They did a lot of tests, discovered a walnut-sized cyst on one of my ovaries. Ovaries are generally about the size of almonds, so basically the cyst was three or four times larger than the ovary it was attached to. I was told that this might be the cause of the problem, but they couldn’t be certain.</p>
            <p>I was admitted to the hospital overnight, and received three units of donated blood. I spent most of the night wishing I could thank the people who had chosen to donate, never knowing they were saving my life. I almost got a fourth unit, but I was just barely over the cutoff line, so they stopped after three.</p>
            <p>Even though I was losing blood through a natural process rather than an injury of some sort, the blood loss still would have resulted in death, had it continued at the current rate. Periods are not meant to be three weeks on and three days off.</p>
            <p>Receiving the donated blood allowed me time to work with the doctors to try and find out the best way to treat me, and what the actual cause of my problem was. After several other things were tried, and after I received four IV infusions of iron, I ended up having a hysterectomy in February, which, of course, literally cut off the source of the bleeding.</p>
            <p>By the blood bank rules, I had to wait an entire year after receiving blood before I was eligible to donate again. It was almost two and a half years before I had recovered to the point I felt strong enough to donate. However, I have donated again, and completed my sixth gallon...and I have replaced one of the three units I used.</p>
