            <h1>A Short History of Blood Donation</h1>
            <h2>Transfusions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1492: First Historical Transfusion Attempt</strong><br>
                The blood of three 10-year-old boys was infused by mouth into Pope Innocent VIII as he sank into a coma. The Pope and the boys died.</li>
                
                <li><strong>1667: First Recorded Human Transfusion</strong><br>
                The first fully documented human blood transfusion was administered in France. King Louis XIV's doctor transfused the blood of a sheep into a 15-year-old boy, who survived. </li>
                
                <li><strong>1818: First Recorded Human-to-Human Transfusion</strong><br>
                British obstetrician and physiologist James Blundell performs the first recorded human-to-human blood transfusion. He injected a patient suffering from internal bleeding with 12 to 14 ounces of blood from several donors. The patient died after initially showing improvement.</li>
                
                <li><strong>1901: Three Main Blood Groups Discovered</strong><br>
                Discovery of the three main human blood groups, A, B, and C, which is later changed to O. Research charts the regular pattern of reaction that occurs after mingling the serum and red cells of an initial set of six blood specimens. </li>
                
                <li><strong>1902: Fourth Blood Group Discovered</strong><br>
                Fourth blood group, AB, is identified.</li>
                
                <li><strong>1907: First Use of Cross Matching</strong><br>
                Cross matching checks the blood of donors and recipients for signs of incompatibility.</li>
                
                <li><strong>1914: First Non-Direct Transfusion</strong><br>
                The first transfusions had to be made directly from donor to receiver before coagulation. Researchers discover that adding sodium citrate to blood will prevent it from clotting. Adding anticoagulant and refrigerating the blood made it possible to store it for days, opening the way for blood banking.</li>
                
                <li><strong>1917: First Blood Depot</strong><br>
                Army doctor collects and stores type O blood, with citrate-glucose solution, in advance of the Battle of Cambrai in World War I.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>1930: First Network of Blood Facilities</strong><br>
                The Soviets are the first to establish a network of facilities to collect and store blood for use in transfusions at hospitals.</li>

                <li><strong>1936: Barcelona Blood-Transfusion Service</strong><br>
                The Barcelona Blood-Transfusion Service collects blood, tests it, pools it by blood group, preserves and stores it in bottles under refrigeration, and by way of vehicles fitted with refrigerators, transports it to front line hospitals during the Spanish Civil War.</li>
                
                <li><strong>1937: Term "Blood Bank" Coined</strong><br>
